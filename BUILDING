Requirements:

* LeapMotion SDK 0.8
* STK 4.4.4

Audio for this application works on top of The Synthesis ToolKit (STK)
STK supports many OS's and audio libraries.

This application was tested with Ubuntu 13.04 with Jack installed.
Since Jack is not a friend of PulseAudio, you will need to disable PulseAudio or use a second sound card, and have jackd daemon running.

You should be able to compile this app in Windows and Mac. It is not tested on those environments.
