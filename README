    Wellcome to LeapTheremin.
    This simple application was made in my spare time.
    Feel free to use it, change it, share it, whatever you want, but if you enjoyed it, please help getting this bigger and better.

    You can contribute with your code, with some money, or simply by giving feedback.
    I will apreciate your help.

    Thank you!
    Germań.
